## Deploying with Envoy

PyroCMS comes with a basic [Envoy.blade.php](https://github.com/pyrocms/pyrocms/blob/3.7/Envoy.blade.php) file for deploying your projects with SSH tasks.
 
You can use your own deployment scripts and logic to emulate our example. Let's take a look at some of the more common deployment tasks:

### Clearing Cache

Use `envoy run clear` to clear **all** caches.

### Pushing Code

Use `envoy run push` to push your code to the server and run any outstanding migrations.

### Updating Dependencies

Use `envoy run update` to update your addons and dependencies and also run any outstanding migrations.

### Compiling

Use `envoy run compile` to re-compile your streams models. This may need to be done if hot fixes were applied directly to streams data in the database.

### Managing Addons

Use `envoy run install|uninstall|reinstall --addon={addon}` to manage addons on the remote. This can also be done from the [Addons module](/documentation/addons-module).
