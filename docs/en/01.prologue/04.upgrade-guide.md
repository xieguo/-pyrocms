**Estimated Upgrade Time: 10 - 15 Minutes**

> We attempt to document every possible change. Since some of these changes are in obscure parts of the API only a portion of these changes may actually affect your application.{.notice}

Before continuing please refer to the [release notes](../prologue/release-notes) to see more information on what has been changed.

### Updating Dependencies

Update your `composer.json` file to match the 3.7 branch core addons and dependencies: https://github.com/pyrocms/pyrocms/blob/3.7/composer.json#L24-L84

Of course, don't forget to examine any additional addons and packages consumed by your application and verify you are using the proper version for PyroCMS 3.7 support.

### Update Configuration

Update your configuration according to the following source files:

- [https://github.com/pyrocms/pyrocms/blob/3.7/config/scout.php](https://github.com/pyrocms/pyrocms/blob/3.7/config/scout.php)
- [https://github.com/pyrocms/pyrocms/blob/3.7/config/logger.php](https://github.com/pyrocms/pyrocms/blob/3.7/config/logger.php)
- [https://github.com/pyrocms/pyrocms/blob/3.7/config/debugbar.php](https://github.com/pyrocms/pyrocms/blob/3.7/config/debugbar.php)
- [https://github.com/pyrocms/pyrocms/blob/3.7/config/httpcache.php](https://github.com/pyrocms/pyrocms/blob/3.7/config/httpcache.php)

### Disable Package Discovery for Laravel

Disable package discovery by appending your `composer.json` file: https://github.com/pyrocms/pyrocms/blob/3.7/composer.json#L127-L131

### Run Migrations

Migrate the core as well as all installed addons:

```bash
php artisan migrate --path=vendor/anomaly/streams-platform/migrations/application
php artisan migrate --all-addons
```

### Clean Up

It's a good idea to freshen up the entire system's caching and performance utilities:

```bash
php artisan httpcache:clear
php artisan assets:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear
php artisan twig:clear
```

### Define Automatic Overrides

PyroCMS will no longer look through all addons for overridden views. You must define them in your theme or other addon using the `$overrides` property or by using the `ViewOverrides` collection directly.
